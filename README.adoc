= CIS 3368 Starter Project

This project is meant to be a starting point for your project.

_Before the project will run_, you will need to:

* Modify the POM and application.properties files with the name of your database
* Create one or more flyway scripts


You should use IntelliJ's refactor mechanism to change the name of your main class and the project to match your project
